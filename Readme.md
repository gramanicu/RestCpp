This is a server/client application that uses tcp/udp connections to receive/send messages on different topics. A UDP client sends messages on a specific topic, and the server forwards the messages to the TCP clients subscribed to that specific topic. This is the 2nd Communication Protocols Course homework. The problem statement / application basic design is described [here (Romanian)](./docs/problem_statement.pdf).
